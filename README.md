# sensing_and_control_unit
Consists of the STM32 microcontroller code for the Sensing and control unit Team B (AquaVision 2026).

Will Publish the following topics:
/sensors/depth
/sensors/orientation
/sensors/accuracy
/control/pwm
/control/led

Calibrate with BNO Calibration code in auv society repo.

/sensors/accuracy gives values from 0-3: Least-Most relable.
